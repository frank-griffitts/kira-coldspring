    <div class="section exterior">
        <img src="Illustrations/loc-bel-townsquare.png" alt="Town Square" class="image-wrap" />
        <h2>Exterior Description</h2>
        <p>The heart of Belladonna is a lively stone-paved square surrounded by three-story buildings, whose architecture blends elven curve and human function. Flower boxes overflow from upper windows, and colorful laundry strings between balconies like festival banners. A central fountain carved from pale marble depicts the mythical Hart of Yew, a sacred stag said to guard lost travelers.</p>
        <p>Around the square are cobbled alleys leading to various guildhouses, shops, and homes. By morning, it bustles with market stalls; by night, it glows with lanterns strung across iron hooks and enchanted lights swaying on gusts of magic.</p>
        <p>Two notable features line up on the wester edge of the square: Mira’s Apothecary and the The Whispering Well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section interior">
        <h2>Interior Description</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Mira’s Apothecary (“Herbs & Whispers”)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Front Room: Shelves packed with dried herbs, potion vials, bundled roots, glowing spores, and small charms. A glass case displays special potions (labeled but locked).</li>
            <li>Counter Area: Scales, ledgers, and an enchanted talking raven named Grackle who gossips freely unless told to hush.</li>
            <li>Back Room: Workbench with alchemical tools, drying racks, and two sleeping cots — one for Mira and one for her cat, Vixie (who may or may not be a disguised familiar).</li>
            <li>Basement: Accessible via ladder — stores older tomes and failed experiments. There’s a hidden niche behind a stone shelf (see Hidden Section).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. The Whispering Well</strong></p>
        <h4>1. Shaft Descent</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The descent begins with carved stone but quickly gives way to rough masonry. Around 30 feet down, the walls begin to sweat with moisture, and glowing green moss appears.
                At 55 feet, the shaft widens into a circular chamber — a crumbled access hub with three tunnels branching off.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Forgotten Aqueduct</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This passage leads to a flooded aqueduct, thigh-deep in brackish water. Cracked statues of elven origin line the wall — their faces worn smooth.
                Faint chanting sometimes echoes from nowhere.</li>
            <li><strong>Trap:</strong> Pressure plate releases a burst of necrotic gas (DC 14 CON save or take 3d6 necrotic).</li>
            <li><strong>Contents:</strong> Old water-purification sigils still glow faintly, causing minor illusions or hallucinations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Ancient Cistern Hall</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A vast vaulted chamber once used for water storage, now drained and dry. The ceiling is covered in stalactites, several of which contain embedded bones.
                A broken metal pipe leaks oily black fluid from the ceiling into a circular pool.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Central Feature:</strong> A massive stone wellhead surrounded by runes. It pulses with energy and connects to the lower catacombs.</li>
            <li><strong>Enemies:</strong> One Whispering Sludge and two Mutated Rats (from consuming the black ichor).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Sealed Door of the Elder Drain</h4>
            <p>
                A massive circular bronze door sealed with three arcane locks. Symbols include an eye, a key, and a spiral.
            </p>
        
        <p><strong>Opening Puzzle:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eye:</strong> Requires casting Detect Magic in the chamber</li>
            <li><strong>Key:</strong> Hidden in the elven statue’s mouth in the aqueduct</li>
            <li><strong>Spiral:</strong> A rotating floor tile puzzle must align spirals with flow markers (INT check DC 15)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond the door lies a vault filled with ancient relics and the deeper tunnels (future expansion).</p>
