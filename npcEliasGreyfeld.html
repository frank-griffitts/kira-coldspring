                    <li><strong>Background Summary:</strong> Elias was once a sentinel of the northern border, a skilled ranger who lost his squad in an ambush. Wandering and broken, he was called back to Belladonna under Elira’s command. He sees himself as Kira’s protector, though his feelings for her run deeper than duty. Elias believes Jorsh’s betrayal is far more sinister than anyone suspects, and he fears for Kira’s heart and soul in the battles to come.</li>

                </ul>
