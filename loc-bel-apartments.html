        <h2>Exterior Description</h2>
        <img src="Illustrations/loc-bel-apartments.png" alt="Quiver Row" class="image-wrap" />
        <p>
            Nestled along the eastern edge of Belladonna’s central ward, the <strong>Ranger Apartment District</strong> is a narrow, sloping cobbled lane known colloquially as “Quiver Row.”
            The street is lined with narrow, stacked stone-and-timber cottages, each no wider than a single wagon but rising up two or three stories like vertical quivers.
            Shuttered windows, wooden balconies, and laundry lines stretch from roof to roof. Most doors are reinforced with dark oak and bear small carvings of wolves, arrows, or crescent moons—symbols of the Rangers Guild.
        </p>
        <p>
            A communal message board stands crooked at the end of the lane, filled with local notices, bounty flyers, and scratched-in jokes. Oil lanterns hang from iron arms along the walls, enchanted to flicker gently at night with a blue-tinted flame.
            The scent of pine tar and roasted game is ever-present.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children of rangers play with wooden swords in the alley, and neighbors tend rooftop gardens. Despite its charm, there’s a hush about the place after sundown—like the street itself listens for returning boots… or ones that never come back.

        <h2>Interior Descriptions</h2>
        <h3>Kira’s Apartment</h3>
        <p>
            A sparse second-story flat with a slanted roof and wide, triangular windows.<br>
            <strong>Living Space:</strong> Bow stands, gear hooks, and a single worn chair by the hearth. A dried pine branch from the Blackpine Forest hangs over the mantel.<br>
            <strong>Sleeping Nook:</strong> A roll-up bedroll, leather-bound journals, and a keepsake locket.<br>
            <strong>Extras:</strong> A small cubby containing childhood drawings and a map torn from the Rangers Guild archive.
        </p>

        <h3>Elias’s Flat</h3>
        <p>
            Neater and better furnished.<br>

        <p>
            Ground-floor and shadowed by ivy.<br>

            <strong>Study:</strong> Filled with old war maps, missing ranger reports, and a hidden drawer under the desk.<br>
            <strong>Back Cellar:</strong> Concealed by a trapdoor, it smells of old blood and smoke. Chains hang from the walls—clearly unused, but unsettling.

    <div class="section backstory">
        <h2>Backstory – Dardick Hawk</h2>
        <p>
            Once a rising star of the Rangers Guild, Dardick disappeared for three years after a mission into the Shadow Marches. He returned changed—more reclusive, more intense, and harboring a shadowy power he never explained. Whispers suggest he struck a pact with something beneath the marshes to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the Guild’s suspicions, he was quietly reinstated. Dardick now mentors new recruits with a bitter edge and patrols the town’s fringe with religious consistency. He trusts no one, not even himself. His nightmares leave claw marks on the walls. And he speaks the name “Nym’kaleth” in his sleep.
        </p>

    <div class="section side-quest">
        <h2>Side Quest – “The Lantern with No Flame”</h2>
        <p><strong>Quest Giver:</strong> Dardick Hawk</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Dardick admits he’s been tracking a “Wisp Lantern,” an eldritch lure that draws rangers into the Hollow Pines where none return. He believes it’s a living curse tied to a missing patrol—one of whom was his old lover. He begs the party to destroy it and return a bone ring he once gave her, now worn by the Wisp.</p>
        <p><strong>Reward:</strong> Bone Ring of Second Breath (revive from 0 HP once/day), Dardick’s Trust (pact sigil lore)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section hidden">
        <h2>Hidden Puzzle – “The Ivy Knot”</h2>
        <p>
            In Dardick’s residence, behind his study bookshelf is a wall overgrown with ivy. If three correct leaves are pulled in sequence (based on a poem hidden in Kira’s apartment), the ivy withers, revealing a forgotten message:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>“I made the pact to save her. I bear the mark so she sleeps.”</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Below it is a rune-locked drawer (Arcana DC 15) containing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A piece of a map to the Shadow Cisterns</li>
            <li>A ring that repels aberrations (resistance to psychic damage 1 min/day)</li>
            <li>A small, shifting stone that mutters under the full moon</li>
        </ul>
