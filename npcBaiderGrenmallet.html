                <h2>Personality & Backstory</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trait:</strong> “I speak with my hands. Usually when they’re holding a hammer.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Ideal:</strong> “Strength means protecting those who can’t protect themselves—even if they hate you for it.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Bond:</strong> “Kira was the only good thing I ever forged. And I broke her.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Flaw:</strong> “I don’t ask for help. I make demands or I leave.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Player's Goal:</strong> To reconcile with Kira, bury old regrets, and protect Belladonna from the dark tide rising from Hemlock Caverns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background Summary:</strong> Baider fought in the Border Wars as a mercenary, forging bonds with adventurers like Onyx the dwarven healer. After a catastrophic delve into Hemlock Caverns, Baider returned to Belladonna where he found a lone half-elf toddler in the ashes of a burned caravan. He raised her—Kira—as if forging steel. But his rough hands and soldier’s mind left scars. She fled him, and now, as darkness rises again, he seeks a second chance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Relationships</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Kira Coldspring:</strong> Adoptive daughter; relationship is strained and unresolved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Onyx the Sage:</strong> Former adventuring companion; bond broken after Hemlock Caverns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jorsh:</strong> Former friend of Kira, betrayed Baider’s trust and the village of Belladonna.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Locations Associated</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Belladonna:</strong> Resides in the village as a blacksmith and war veteran.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hemlock Caverns:</strong> Site of past trauma and a failed expedition with Onyx.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baider’s Forge:</strong> Contains a secret tunnel to the catacombs and a shrine to fallen comrades.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gruff but fiercely loyal; actions speak louder than words.</li>
                    <li>Uses blunt, terse dialogue; often dry or bitterly humorous.</li>
                    <li>Keeps a war memorial to fallen friends in a hidden alcove.</li>
                    <li>Sharpens weapons to distract from emotional pain.</li>
                    <li>Suspicious of magic and fate—especially after Onyx’s “visions.”</li>
