        <h2>Exterior Description</h2>
        <p>The tavern is nestled between leaning timber buildings near the edge of the Belladonna town square. Its moss-covered roof slouches into the street. Above the crooked door hangs a weather-beaten sign depicting a dragon skull dripping red liquid into a goblet. Lanterns of pale amber light swing on rusted hooks. The faint scent of roasted boar and pipe smoke drifts out through the cracked shutters. Locals say the tavern was built atop the bones of a wyrmling slain by Belladonna’s founders. Its wine casks were once baptized in its blood.</p>

        <h2>Interior Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Taproom:</strong> Lit by a massive fireplace with a mounted wyvern skull. Tables are mismatched and the floorboards creak loudly with every step. A three-eyed tabby cat named Mischief lounges on the bar, considered a lucky omen.</li>
            <li><strong>The Snare Stage:</strong> A small raised platform where minstrels, gamblers, and once—a wrestling kobold—perform nightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Alcoves:</strong> Deep booths with curtains and silencing runes for clandestine meetings. The barkeep charges extra for “discreet ears.”</li>
            <li><strong>The Cellar:</strong> Barrel-lined and cool, used for ale, bribes, and the occasional corpse. A reinforced trapdoor leads to… something the staff insists is just “rats.”</li>
            <li><strong>Upstairs Rooms:</strong> Three guest rooms. One is always booked by a mysterious elf who never speaks. Another is rumored haunted. The third is just full of mushrooms for some reason.</li>
        </ul>
