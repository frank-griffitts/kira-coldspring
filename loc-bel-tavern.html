            <h3>Exterior Description</h3>
            <p>
                The tavern is nestled between leaning timber buildings near the edge of the Belladonna town square.
                Its moss-covered roof slouches into the street.
                Above the crooked door hangs a weather-beaten sign depicting a dragon skull dripping red liquid into a goblet.
                Lanterns of pale amber light swing on rusted hooks.
                The faint scent of roasted boar and pipe smoke drifts out through the cracked shutters.
                Locals say the tavern was built atop the bones of a wyrmling slain by Belladonna’s founders.
                Its wine casks were once baptized in its blood.

        <section class="location-interior">
            <h3>Interior Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Main Taproom:</strong> Lit by a massive fireplace with a mounted wyvern skull. Tables are mismatched and the floorboards creak loudly with every step. A three-eyed tabby cat named Mischief lounges on the bar, considered a lucky omen.</p>
            <p><strong>The Snare Stage:</strong> A small raised platform where minstrels, gamblers, and once—a wrestling kobold—perform nightly.</p>
            <p><strong>Private Alcoves:</strong> Deep booths with curtains and silencing runes for clandestine meetings. The barkeep charges extra for “discreet ears.”</p>
            <p><strong>The Cellar:</strong> Barrel-lined and cool, used for ale, bribes, and the occasional corpse. A reinforced trapdoor leads to… something the staff insists is just “rats.”</p>
            <p><strong>Upstairs Rooms:</strong> Three guest rooms. One is always booked by a mysterious elf who never speaks. Another is rumored haunted. The third is just full of mushrooms for some reason.</p>

            <h3>NPC Backstory</h3>
            <p>
                Trelga is a former adventurer turned innkeeper who fought in the War of the Hollow Tree. She keeps a dragonborn’s severed fang behind the bar (reputedly from the eponymous “wyrm”). She has known Baider since their mercenary days and secretly once worked for the Hawthorn family as a courier during the rebellion. Trelga now trades in ale and information, and nothing much escapes her notice in Belladonna. She won’t talk for coin, but she might for trust… or vengeance.
            </p>

        <section class="location-quest">
            <h3>Side Quest – “The Whisper in the Keg”</h3>
            <p>
                Trelga confides that one of her prized ale barrels is speaking at night, whispering secrets about Varis, Kira, and the Shadow Realm. Inside is a bound homunculus familiar belonging to a murdered sorcerer. Trelga wants the truth — and someone brave enough to “tap the truth” without getting cursed, killed, or possessed.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reward:</strong> The Wyrmblood Token – Advantage on any Charisma check made within Belladonna once per day.</p>

            <h3>Hidden Room, Puzzle, and Treasure – The Cursed Keg Puzzle</h3>
            <p>
                In the cellar lies a sealed cask marked with black claw sigils. It's locked with three runic bands, each opened with a riddle.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>"The more you take, the more I grow. What am I?"</em> → Answer: A hole</li>
                <li><em>"Born of flame, fed by song, I vanish when I’m seen."</em> → Answer: A secret</li>
                <li><em>"I have no life, but I can die. What am I?"</em> → Answer: A reputation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Success:</strong> Unlocks the cask containing the homunculus and a map fragment to the Shadow Cisterns.<br>
                <strong>Failure (3 wrong attempts):</strong> A burst of psychic energy (4d6 psychic, DC 13 Int save for half).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Inside the keg:</strong></p>
