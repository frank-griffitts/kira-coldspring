        <img src="Illustrations/loc-bel-magistrate.png" alt="Magistrate's Hall" class="image-wrap" />
        <h2>Exterior Description</h2>
        <p>The Magistrate Hall looms in the heart of Belladonna’s central square — a somber, ivy-choked stone building with arched gothic windows, an iron clock tower, and a pair of tarnished bronze gryphon statues guarding its stairs. A pair of banners hang from the second-floor balcony: the green-and-gold sigil of Belladonna and the darker royal sigil of the Hawthorn family.</p>
        <p>Vines creep up the north side, as if trying to reclaim the structure. The stones are chipped, stained from weather and time. Black wrought-iron lanterns glow with soft witchlight in the evenings. Crows frequently roost on the clock tower, adding to its eerie reputation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section interior">
        <h2>Interior Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entrance Lobby:</strong> High vaulted ceilings, a cold stone floor, and a worn red carpet. Citizens line up before a counter where a sleepy clerk files complaints and petitions. Iron chandeliers burn whale-oil lanterns. A statue of the first Magistrate (head missing) stands awkwardly in one corner.</li>
            <li><strong>Council Chamber:</strong> A round room with tiered seats for council members. The Magistrate’s seat is elevated at the far end, beneath a stained glass window of Lady Belladonna, founder of the township. Hidden runes in the glass flicker under moonlight.</li>
            <li><strong>Magistrate’s Office:</strong> Dark mahogany furnishings. Two massive bookshelves cover walls filled with tax records, court scrolls, and blackmail dossiers. A globe with secret compartments. A hidden drawer in the desk holds royal correspondence and illegal alchemy contracts.</li>
            <li><strong>Archive Vault:</strong> Locked behind a steel-reinforced door with a glyph of warding. Scrolls, prisoner logs, deeds, bounty contracts. One shelf is disguised — leading to the secret chamber (see section f).</li>
            <li><strong>Holding Cells:</strong> Four cramped cells guarded by two sleepy watchmen. Prisoners range from petty thieves to political prisoners “awaiting quiet relocation.”</li>
            <li><strong>Detention Officer Quarters:</strong> Two level one fighters are usually here around the clock doing shift work to watch the prisoners and perform intake duties.</li>
            <li><strong>Bailiffs’ Quarters:</strong> One level one fighter is usually here during daytime hours when court is in session.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Trial War Room:</strong> This is a conference room that usually sits empty with a large oak table and a dozen chairs for people of importance to strategize around critical incidents and proceedings.</li>
            <li><strong>Rooftop Observatory:</strong> Magistrate Dellmar’s private retreat. An enchanted spyglass allows him to observe the town and incoming roadways. Used for both stargazing and surveillance.</li>

        <h2>Backstory: Magistrate Corvin Dellmar Pinkerton</h2>
        <p>Corvin rose quickly from a minor noble family due to his cleverness and subtle ruthlessness. He is charming and calculating, known for his “open ear” policy — listening to citizen woes while slowly ensnaring them in deals they can’t escape. Unknown to most, he is in secret communication with Varis, the Dark Elf Minister of Trade, and has sold access to Belladonna’s underground passages in exchange for power and forbidden knowledge.</p>
        <p>Corvin’s pact is with the Unspeaking Court, eldritch entities from the Shadow Realm. His dreams are plagued by whispers, and he believes he’s destined to be the true ruler of Belladonna when the Hawthorns fall.</p>

        <h1>The Magistrate’s Hidden Dungeon</h1>
        <img src="Illustrations/loc-bel-magistratesDungeon.png" alt="Secret Dungeon" class="image-wrap" />
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Beneath the Belladonna Magistrate Hall (see Location 2)</p>
        <p><strong>Hidden Purpose:</strong> A covert prison and torture chamber used by the Magistrate for political enemies, secret debtors, and victims of blackmail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section exterior">
        <h2>Exterior Description</h2>
        <p>
            There is no external entrance to this dungeon. Access is granted only via a hidden stone spiral stair beneath the Magistrate’s private wine cellar, revealed by twisting a bottle labeled <em>“Belladonna Reserve — 869 DR”</em>. The stone floor silently rotates, revealing black iron steps that descend into darkness.
            The air grows cold almost instantly, and the sound of dripping water echoes below like whispers in a stone throat. The walls are damp, and faint blue glyphs pulse with anti-divination magic.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section interior">
        <h2>Interior Chambers</h2>

        <h3>1. Holding Corridor (The Maw)</h3>
        <p>
            A long hallway flanked by ten narrow iron-barred cells, each with stone floors and ceilings. Prisoners are kept in magically silenced isolation; any attempt to scream is muffled unless a Dispel Magic is cast.
            The far wall bears the emblem of the Magistrate’s office, but warped into a weeping face. Hidden chains in the ceiling can be dropped via a switch in the observation room above.
        </p>

        <h3>2. The Interrogation Chamber (“The Root Cellar”)</h3>
        <p>
            A stone-walled circular chamber with a drainage grate in the center and chains hanging from all four walls. The floor is slightly bowl-shaped to collect blood. Shelves along the walls house elixirs, truth serums (some expired), and magical implements.
            A red-glowing rune circle in the floor can force a creature to relive its worst memory (<em>DC 17 Wis save or be incapacitated by despair for 1 minute</em>).
            A disguised viewing lens in the ceiling allows the Magistrate or his aides to observe from above.
        </p>

        <h3>3. The Archive of Names</h3>
        <p>
            A dusty side room filled with hundreds of scrolls, each bound in black ribbon and labeled with names and dates. Every scroll details the crimes—real or fabricated—of those held or killed in the dungeon.
            Touching one scroll without permission triggers a glyph trap (<em>Hold Person, DC 15</em>).
            One scroll bears <strong>Kira Coldspring’s</strong> name—falsely implicating her in a conspiracy with Jorsh the Betrayer.
        </p>

        <h3>4. The Forbidden Door (Sealed Cell #X)</h3>
        <p>
            An adamantine door sealed with a glyph of warding and three locking mechanisms (arcane, mundane, and blood-coded). Behind it is Prisoner X—a former royal steward who discovered the Magistrate’s alliance with Minister Varis and refused to stay quiet.
            Prisoner X is alive but broken, barely sane, and guards a mind-fragment of a secret that could bring down both Varis and the Magistrate.

        <h2>Backstory: Magistrate Velloran Duskmere</h2>
        <p>
            Duskmere came from humble beginnings but rose quickly through the judiciary by being ruthlessly efficient and always one step ahead of scandals. He was once a just man, but was ensnared by Minister Varis’s web of leverage and promises of power.
            He now maintains this hidden dungeon as a tool to eliminate threats quietly, imprison political enemies, or manipulate nobles into “cooperation.”
            Despite his outward calm and refined demeanor, Duskmere is deeply paranoid, keeping records on everyone—especially Kira Coldspring and Princess Hawthorn.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a <strong>1d4</strong> chance that Duskmere is in the dungeon or in the Magistrate's office, visiting Magistrate Pinkerton as an emissary from the Royal Palace.
