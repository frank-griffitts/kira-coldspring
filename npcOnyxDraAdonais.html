                    <li><strong>Bond:</strong> “Kira must be protected. Her bloodline may hold the key to restoring the Gate.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Flaw:</strong> “I speak cryptically… because I fear what will happen when I speak plainly.”</li>
                    <li><strong>Player's Goal:</strong> To awaken fully as Adonais, protect Kira from the Shadowborn, and stop the rise of Yaldaboath and Varis’s schemes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background Summary:</strong> Onyx, once a humble healer and scribe, reawakened ancient memories of his life as the Archon Adonais after entering the Hemlock Caverns with Baider. That event changed him, driving a wedge between old allies. Now he resides in Belladonna, eccentric and enigmatic, preparing for a rising darkness that only he seems to remember clearly.</li>

                    <li><strong>Baider:</strong> Former friend turned estranged after their journey to the Dark Gate; rift formed due to Onyx’s obsession with prophecy.</li>

                <h2>Quotes</h2>
                <h3>Casual Conversation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>"Hmm. Leylines are twitchy today. Might be storms tonight."</li>
                    <li>"Did I ever tell you the tale of the third sun? No? Good."</li>
                    <li>"Ah, yes. Tea... and maybe a touch of celestial revelation."</li>
                    <li>"Ah, the simple life. It's a fine disguise for a very complicated existence."</li>
                    <li>"A good brew takes time. Like true wisdom, it cannot be rushed."</li>
                    <li>"One must always be prepared, even for the day's trivialities. A sturdy shield is as useful against a stray dog as a demon."</li>
                    <li>"I often find clarity in the hearth's glow. The dancing flames have a way of revealing paths."</li>
                    <li>"Young ones are always so eager to charge forward. They forget the quiet strength of what stands still."</li>
                    <li>There's more to this world than meets the eye, little one. Much, much more."</li>
                    <li>"I may seem a doddering sage, but my memory stretches further back than these hills."</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Deeper/Private Conversation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>"The Archons... they were once perfect. But even light can fracture, and in the cracks, darkness finds a home."</li>
                    <li>"My true form... it is not meant for this plane. Too much power, too much memory, to be contained in simple flesh."</li>
                    <li>"I chose this path, this disguise, to walk among you. To understand the small heartbeats of mortals before the great reckoning."</li>
                    <li>"Yaldaboath is not merely a demon; he is a wound in the very fabric of existence, born from a failed divine purpose."</li>
                    <li>"Baider... he saw a glimpse of what I am, what I must become. It broke him, and I regret that pain."</li>
                    <li>"The Whispering Pines themselves remember the old pacts, the ancient wards. They groan with the strain of holding the darkness back."</li>
                    <li>"To be Adonais is to be eternally vigilant. To carry the weight of countless forgotten battles. The sleep of mortals is a luxury I cannot afford."</li>
                    <li>"Kira carries a spark of the old world, a lineage intertwined with the Shadow. She is a key, whether she knows it or not."</li>
                    <li>"Every choice, every betrayal, every whisper in the dark... it all weaves into the tapestry of the coming war. And my place in it is not yet fully revealed."</li>
                    <li>"The deepest magic is not in spells, but in the echoes of purpose that resonate through time. I am an echo, and soon, a clarion call."</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Plot Hooks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>May call upon the players to retrieve a shattered relic needed to delay Yaldaboath’s emergence.</li>
                    <li>Secretly preparing a ritual that may awaken Adonais fully—at the cost of Onyx's mortal self.</li>
                    <li>Could guide players through the Hemlock Caverns, revealing lost truths and forgotten traps.</li>
                </ul>
