        <p>The air in Hemlock Caverns is thick with tension, the echo of your footsteps barely audible over the low rumble of distant waterfalls. You stand with your sword leveled at Jorsh, the boy who was once your friend, your love—and now your enemy. His dark eyes glitter in the dim light of the cavern, a mixture of defiance and something else. He is no longer the person you once knew.</p>

        <p>"Shackle your wrists," you command, the words sharper than the blade you hold.</p>

        <p>Jorsh’s smile is bitter, crooked. He leans back against a rock, his posture too relaxed, too sure of himself, and it unnerves you. “You’re really going through with this?” he asks, his voice smooth, as if he’s trying to lull you into complacency. “I could offer you power, Kira. Together, we could destroy Varis, save Belladonna—no one would ever question us again.”</p>

        <p>Your heart clenches at his words. For a moment, you see the boy you once cared for, the one who used to sneak you stolen sweets from the bakery. But you shake off the sentiment. Those days are gone. Jorsh abandoned you—he abandoned everything.</p>

        <p>“I’m here to bring you to justice,” you say, your voice steady, though the weight of your duty presses against your chest. “I’m not here to save you.”</p>

        <p>He stares at you, a flicker of something dangerous in his eyes. Then, with a slow, mocking nod, he reaches into his cloak and produces the manacles. His fingers brush yours as he places the cold iron over his wrists, and you can't shake the feeling of wrongness—like touching a snake before it strikes.</p>

        <p>The metal clicks into place. He looks down at the shackles, his lips twitching in amusement. "Is this what you wanted?" he murmurs.</p>

        <p>A shiver crawls up your spine, but you ignore it, stepping back to assess your prisoner. “We’re going back to Belladonna. Now,” you say, gripping the hilt of your sword more tightly.</p>

        <p>He watches you, his gaze unreadable, before tilting his head slightly. "Do you really think it's that simple?"</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-115-2.jpg" alt="Jorsh" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>Before you can react, his hands jerk upward, the chains rattling as his fingers trace arcane symbols in the air. Too late, you realize the shackles were never meant to bind him. Dark magic pulses through the cavern, sending a gust of wind spiraling around you. You rush forward, but the force of the spell slams into you, knocking you off your feet.</p>

        <p>The world tilts as you hit the ground hard, the breath forced from your lungs. Pain flares through your ribs, and your sword clatters to the stone floor, out of reach. You scramble to stand, but the cavern begins to blur, the edges of your vision darkening.</p>

        <p>“Jorsh!” you shout, but his name is swallowed by the roar of power building around him.</p>

        <p>He doesn’t answer. Instead, he looks down at you with something like regret, though his smile never falters. “You should’ve let me explain, Kira,” he says softly, his voice echoing in the vast emptiness. “I didn’t want it to end like this.”</p>

        <p>In a blinding flash of light, he vanishes, his body dissolving into the darkness like mist before the dawn. The spell’s aftershock washes over you, and you’re thrown back, your head hitting the ground with a sickening thud.</p>

        <p>For a moment, everything goes silent.</p>

        <p>Then pain blooms behind your eyes, dragging you back into consciousness. You force your eyes open, but the cavern spins, disorienting you. Your fingers grasp for your sword, finding only cold stone. Panic rises in your throat as you struggle to your feet, staggering to where Jorsh had been standing only moments ago.</p>

        <p>Gone.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-115-3.jpg" alt="Jorsh" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>The binders lie empty on the ground, the chains twisted and broken by his magic. Your pulse pounds in your ears as you clutch your side, pain radiating through your body from the impact.</p>

        <p>How could he have escaped so easily?</p>

        <p>You failed. The weight of it hits you hard, like a stone settling in your chest. After everything—tracking him through the mountains, outwitting his traps—you couldn’t stop him. The boy you once loved is lost to dark magic, and now, he’s free again.</p>

        <p>The mission, your duty, the honor of Belladonna—everything is slipping through your fingers. You can almost hear the Magistrate’s voice in your head, the stern command to bring Jorsh back, dead or alive. But you couldn’t bring yourself to kill him, not when he was standing right in front of you.</p>

        <p>You lean against the cavern wall, sucking in deep breaths to steady yourself. The pain in your side doesn’t fade, but you force your body to move, limping toward the exit. Hemlock Caverns stretches on, its dark corridors winding deeper into the earth. If you don’t leave now, you’ll lose more than just Jorsh.</p>

        <p>The thought of returning to Belladonna without him, without completing your mission, stings more than the physical pain. What will Baider say? What about Elias? The image of Elias’s hopeful face flashes in your mind, his unspoken affection for you always lingering between the two of you. Will he understand the choice you made?</p>

        <p>No time for regret. You’ll have to make your way out and regroup. Jorsh is still out there—somewhere. And next time, you won’t hesitate.</p>
