        <p>The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the village of Belladonna. You stand in the clearing just outside the Ranger’s Guild House, your heart heavy with conflicting emotions. Elias’s confession rattles you, stirring feelings you thought you buried deep alongside the memory of Jorsh. As he gazes at you, hope shining in his eyes, you feel the weight of the past press down harder.</p>

        <p>“I can’t, Elias,” you say, your voice barely above a whisper. “I can’t let you come with me. Not this time.” You take a step back, creating a distance that feels as necessary as it is painful.</p>

        <p>Elias’s expression falters, confusion crossing his handsome features. “But Kira, you don’t have to do this alone. You need help, and I—”</p>

        <p>“I don’t need your help!” You cut him off, the words sharp and bitter in your mouth. “You don’t understand what I’m facing. This isn’t just a simple hunt. It’s about Jorsh and the darkness he’s tangled in. I can’t risk putting you in danger.”</p>

        <p>His brow furrows, and the hurt in his eyes twists the knife deeper into your chest. “But I care about you, Kira. I can’t just stand by while you risk your life. Let me help you.”</p>

        <p>You turn away, the weight of his affection pressing against your resolve. Memories of Jorsh flood your mind, his laughter and warmth clashing with the pain of his betrayal. The ache in your heart feels fresh, and you can’t let Elias fill that void. Not now. Not ever.</p>

        <p>“I need to do this on my own,” you say, your voice steadier. “It’s my responsibility to find Jorsh. I can handle a quick investigation at the Ministry of Trade.” You glance back at him, your determination hardening. “You can help by scouting ahead, checking for dangers in Hemlock Pass.”</p>

        <p>Elias looks like he wants to argue, but you see the defeat in his posture. With a heavy sigh, he nods, his eyes lingering on you as if trying to memorize every detail. “Fine. But promise me you’ll be careful.”</p>

        <p>“I promise,” you lie, the words feeling like a stone in your throat. You both part ways, and you steel yourself for what lies ahead.</p>

        <p>As you approach the Ministry of Trade, the imposing structure looms like a dark shadow, a place where secrets thrive. You slip through the back entrance, your heart racing as you navigate the dimly lit corridors. Whispers echo around you, and the scent of stale parchment fills the air.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-11-2.jpg" alt="Kira" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>In the back room, you pause, your pulse quickening as you overhear voices through a cracked door. Peering inside, you catch sight of Varis, the Minister of Trade, surrounded by his advisors, their faces twisted in malicious glee.</p>

        <p>“The portal must be opened before the next full moon,” Varis commands, his voice dripping with authority. “With the relic from Hemlock Falls, we will summon the dark elves and take the Kingdom of Yew by storm. No one will stand in our way!”</p>

        <p>Your breath hitches in your throat as you take in the gravity of their plans. The relic! You know you have to act fast before Varis can put his plan into motion. But you feel the weight of your decisions pressing down on you as dread creeps in. You have to confront him, to uncover the truth, even if it means risking everything.</p>

        <p>Summoning your courage, you fling the door open and step into the room. “Infidel! I know what you’re planning!”</p>

        <p>The room falls silent as the advisors turn, surprise and recognition flashing across their faces. Varis, however, merely smirks, an expression that chills you to the bone. “Ah, the little ranger. How quaint. You’ve come to play the hero?”</p>

        <p>“Your treachery ends here!” you shout, trying to mask the tremor in your voice. “By the authority of the crown vested in the Belladonna Ranger’s Guild, I am placing you under arrest.” You draw your sword and point it at Varis.</p>

        <p>Varis chuckles darkly, the sound sending shivers down your spine. “You truly think you can stop me? You’re nothing but a child playing at bravery.” He raises a hand, dark energy swirling around his fingers.</p>

        <p>You lunge forward, desperation fueling your movements. “You won’t get away with this!”</p>

        <p>But he is faster. A pulse of dark energy shoots from his hand, and you feel it crash into you like a tidal wave. The force knocks you off your feet, sending you crashing into the wall. Pain explodes through your body as you gasp for air, struggling to rise.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-11-3.jpg" alt="Kira" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>“Pathetic,” Varis sneers, stepping closer, the shadows gathering around him like a cloak. “You thought you could disrupt my plans? You’re just another pawn in this game.”</p>

        <p>You struggle to regain your footing, defiance burning within you. “I won’t let you take my home! I won’t let you take anyone else from me!”</p>

        <p>But your strength wanes. With a flick of his wrist, Varis unleashes another surge of magic, and the world blurs around you. Your vision fades to black, darkness enveloping you as the last vestiges of consciousness slip away.</p>

        <p><strong>Elias! Baider!</strong> you think, hoping that somehow they will come for you.</p>

        <p>You awaken in a darkened chamber, the echoes of your own screams still ringing in your ears. Panic floods through you as you realize you’re alone, your surroundings unfamiliar and oppressive. You strain against your restraints, fighting against the weight of despair settling in your chest.</p>

        <p>You’ve failed. The Minister of Trade has succeeded, and all hope for the Kingdom of Yew hangs in the balance. In your moment of bravado, you’ve walked into a trap, and now you fear the worst for your home.</p>

        <p>As the shadows close in, you understand the tragic truth: sometimes the bravest hearts fall victim to the very darkness they seek to fight.</p>

        <p>With that realization weighing heavy in your heart, you succumb to the darkness, knowing that your choices have sealed the fate of Belladonna, and perhaps the entire kingdom.</p>
