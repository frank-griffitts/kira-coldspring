        <p>You stand at the entrance of Hemlock Caverns, the damp air seeping into your skin. The towering stone arch above seems to pulse with ancient magic, an ominous reminder of the dangers that lie within. At your side is Princess Hawthorn, her regal demeanor wavering slightly as she gazes into the cavern’s depths. She’s not used to places like this, far removed from the marble floors of the palace. You, on the other hand, feel a strange mix of dread and familiarity. You’ve been here before, years ago, but not under these circumstances.</p>

        <p>Behind you, Liora, the court sorceress, mutters an incantation under her breath. A shimmering aura of protection envelops the three of you, her magic filling the air with a faint hum. It's a small comfort, but you know that nothing is certain in this place, especially now that Jorsh is involved. The thought of him sends a pang through your chest—a mixture of anger, loss, and something you’d rather not name. Not here, not now.</p>

        <p>Princess Hawthorn clears her throat, breaking the tense silence. "We must find the portal before Varis does," she says, her voice steady but her eyes betraying her fear. "If he opens the way to the Realm of Shadows, all of Yew is doomed."</p>

        <p>You nod, gripping your bow tighter. "We’ll stop him," you promise, though the weight of your words feels heavy. You can't help but think of Jorsh—his obsession with the portal, his thirst for power. He's no longer the boy you once knew, but a man consumed by dark magic and vengeance. And yet, a part of you still hopes for something more, some piece of him that you can still reach.</p>

        <p>As you venture deeper into the cavern, the walls close in around you, dripping with moisture and age-old decay. The air grows colder, your breath visible in front of you. Liora walks a few steps ahead, her hand outstretched as she guides the way with her magic. Hawthorn stays close to you, her royal facade cracking more with each passing minute.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, Liora halts, her eyes narrowing. "There’s something here… something wrong," she whispers.</p>

        <p>Before you can react, a shadow darts from the darkness, striking Liora in the chest with a burst of dark energy. She crumples to the ground, the protective spell shattering like glass. You whirl around, drawing your bow, but it's too late—Jorsh emerges from the shadows, his face twisted with grim determination. His black robes swirl around him like smoke, and his eyes gleam with an intensity that both frightens and fascinates you.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-30-2.jpg" alt="Kira" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>"You’ve come too far, Kira," he says, his voice low and commanding. With a flick of his wrist, Princess Hawthorn is bound in chains of shadow, her cry of shock silenced by the magic that binds her. She struggles, but the bindings hold her firm.</p>

        <p>"Jorsh!" you shout, your heart racing as your mind races for a solution. Your arrow is aimed at him, but your hands tremble. Memories of the boy you once loved flash before your eyes, and for a brief moment, you hesitate.</p>

        <p>Jorsh’s lips curl into a mocking smile. "I’m not here to hurt you, Kira. I’m here to save you. Varis is a threat to everything—Yew, Belladonna, even your precious princess here. You should be helping me, not them." His eyes soften, and for a fleeting moment, you see a trace of the boy you once knew. "Join me, Kira. We can end this, together."</p>

        <p>His words twist in your chest like a knife. Could you trust him? Could he really be trying to stop Varis, or is this just another lie?</p>

        <p>"Don’t listen to him!" Hawthorn cries, struggling against the chains. "He’s using you, Kira! If you help him, everything will be lost!"</p>

        <p>The choice before you feels like it could tear you apart. Jorsh stands there, waiting, his expression a strange mixture of hope and desperation. And despite everything, a part of you wants to believe him.</p>

        <p>You have to choose.</p>
