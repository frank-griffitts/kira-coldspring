        <img src="Illustrations/section-600-1.jpg" alt="Kira and Elias" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>You stand there, heart pounding, as Elias' words hang in the air. He suggests splitting up, his voice low and uncertain. The effects of the hag’s dark magic linger in his eyes, shadowing his usual warmth with doubt. He believes you’d be better off without him. He’s wrong. You know it, but can you make him see it?</p>

        <p>For a moment, the world around you fades—the jagged rocks of the Shadow Realm, the cold, oppressive air of this cursed place, even the constant hum of danger that has followed you since you arrived. All that matters is him, standing so close, yet feeling so far away. You can see the hurt in his eyes, the battle between his love for you and the belief that he’s nothing more than a burden.</p>

        <p>"Elias," you whisper, stepping forward. He doesn’t move, his jaw clenched, fists tight at his sides. "You’re wrong."</p>

        <p>Without giving him a chance to reply, you grab the front of his tunic, pulling him down into a kiss. It’s desperate, raw, filled with all the unspoken words between you. For that moment, you pour your heart into it, hoping he can feel everything you’ve never been able to say—how much you care for him, how grateful you are for his presence, and how, despite everything, he is not a burden.</p>

        <p>He stiffens at first, surprised. But then his hands come up to your waist, pulling you closer as he returns the kiss, equally fierce and yearning. For a moment, the world stills. There is only you and him, locked in this bittersweet embrace.</p>

        <p>But it’s fleeting. As your lips part, you can see the conflict raging behind his eyes. He cups your face gently, his touch lingering as if memorizing the feel of you. "Kira..." His voice is thick, his resolve wavering. "I can’t do this anymore. Not like this. You need to find Jorsh. You need to finish this mission... without me."</p>

        <p>His words cut deep, but you know he means it. You’ve seen how the hag’s dark magic has twisted his thoughts. He’s convinced himself that walking away is the best way to protect you, even if it tears him apart inside.</p>

        <p>You don’t try to stop him when he pulls away, though every fiber of your being wants to. As he turns and walks into the shadows, the emptiness he leaves behind feels suffocating.</p>

        <p>“Goodbye, Kira,” he murmurs, his figure vanishing into the gloom.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-600-2.jpg" alt="Kira and Shamurel" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>You stand there, shaken, watching the man you love disappear into the dark. And though it breaks your heart, you know that you still have a mission to complete. You still need to find Baider. With Elias gone, Shamurel steps up beside you, his eyes unreadable as he motions toward the path ahead.</p>

        <p>“Come on, lass,” the goblin says. “We still have work to do.”</p>

        <p>You follow Shamurel through the twisting, treacherous paths of the Shadow Realm. The dark cliffs rise above you, casting eerie shadows over everything, and the air grows colder the closer you get to Umbra’Thal. Shamurel is eerily silent, guiding you through hidden pathways and tunnels only he seems to know. You feel the weight of Elias’ absence pressing down on your chest, but there’s no time to grieve. Not yet.</p>

        <p>The city of Umbra’Thal looms ahead, its black spires reaching into the sky like jagged teeth. The capital of the dark elves radiates malevolent energy, and you can feel the ancient magic pulsing through the very ground beneath your feet. You and Shamurel sneak past patrols, slipping through the narrow alleyways that wind through the dark city. Every corner you turn, you expect to be caught, but Shamurel knows this place well.</p>

        <p>Yet, despite his cunning, you are not prepared for the dark elves. A battalion of them appears from the shadows, their armor glinting in the dim light, and they surround you before you can draw your bow. Shamurel tries to fight, but he’s quickly overpowered. Their leader, a tall elf with cold, dead eyes, raises his hand, and a surge of magic ripples through the air, freezing you in place. You try to resist, but your limbs betray you, locked by his spell.</p>

        <p>“You’ve come far, half-elf,” the leader sneers, stepping closer. “But you won’t go any further.”</p>

        <p>You and Shamurel are dragged through the streets of Umbra’Thal, past darkened windows and towering fortresses, until you’re thrown into a cold, damp dungeon. The iron bars slam shut behind you with a resounding clang, and the darkness presses in on you from all sides.</p>

        <p>And then, in the corner of the cell, you see him. Baider. Your heart clenches at the sight of him. He’s battered, bruised, and barely recognizable, his body broken from torture. He looks up when you approach, his eyes glazed with pain, but there’s still a flicker of recognition.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-600-3.jpg" alt="Kira and Baider" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>“Kira...” His voice is hoarse, barely a whisper.</p>

        <p>You rush to his side, cradling his head in your lap, your fingers trembling as you check his wounds. “I’m here, Baider. I’m going to get you out of here.”</p>

        <p>But as you speak, you feel the weight of the situation crashing down on you. The dark elves are everywhere. Varis is growing stronger, closer to his goal of summoning Yaldaboath. And now Elias is gone, leaving you to face this nightmare alone.</p>

        <p>Baider’s hand reaches up weakly, grasping your arm. “It’s... too late for me,” he murmurs, his voice strained. “But you... you have to stop them... before it’s too late.”</p>

        <p>Tears blur your vision, but you shake your head. “No, I’m not leaving you here.”</p>

        <p>Baider’s grip tightens slightly, the last remnants of his strength in that gesture. “You... must...”</p>

        <p>His words hang in the air like a death sentence. You know what he’s asking of you, and it tears at your soul. But even as the weight of his plea settles over you, the truth becomes clear: time is running out. If you don’t act soon, all of Yew—and the people you care about—will fall to Varis and the dark elves.</p>

        <p>As Baider’s hand slips from your arm, his eyes flutter closed, and you know you fate now rests in the hands of Jorsh and Elias.</p>
