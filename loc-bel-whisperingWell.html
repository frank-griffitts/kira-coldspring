            <h2>The Town Well & Underground Cistern Caverns</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Kingdom:</strong> Yew<br>
                <strong>Township:</strong> Belladonna<br>
                <strong>Current Overseer:</strong> None officially — secretly monitored by Magistrate Dellmar
            </p>

            <h3>a. Exterior Description: The Town Well</h3>
            <p>
                Nestled at the edge of Belladonna’s central square, the town well is a round stone structure with a crumbling lip and rusted pulley crank.
                Weeds grow between the stones, and a faded wooden sign reads “Drink not past the frost moon.” Locals avoid it, claiming the water “tastes wrong” and sometimes “talks back.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The wooden bucket is missing, the rope snapped. A faint, cold wind sometimes rises from the shaft, even on windless days. Crows perch on the rim and watch silently.
                Beneath the well, the shaft descends nearly 60 feet into darkness, where crumbling stone opens into the ancient cistern tunnels below.
            </p>

            <h3>b. Interior Description: The Cistern Caverns</h3>

            <h4>1. Shaft Descent</h4>
            <p>
                The descent begins with carved stone but quickly gives way to rough masonry. Around 30 feet down, the walls begin to sweat with moisture, and glowing green moss appears.
                At 55 feet, the shaft widens into a circular chamber — a crumbled access hub with three tunnels branching off.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Forgotten Aqueduct</h4>
            <p>
                This passage leads to a flooded aqueduct, thigh-deep in brackish water. Cracked statues of elven origin line the wall — their faces worn smooth.
                Faint chanting sometimes echoes from nowhere.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Trap:</strong> Pressure plate releases a burst of necrotic gas (DC 14 CON save or take 3d6 necrotic).</p>
            <p><strong>Contents:</strong> Old water-purification sigils still glow faintly, causing minor illusions or hallucinations.</p>

            <h4>3. Ancient Cistern Hall</h4>
            <p>
                A vast vaulted chamber once used for water storage, now drained and dry. The ceiling is covered in stalactites, several of which contain embedded bones.
                A broken metal pipe leaks oily black fluid from the ceiling into a circular pool.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Central Feature:</strong> A massive stone wellhead surrounded by runes. It pulses with energy and connects to the lower catacombs.</p>
            <p><strong>Enemies:</strong> One Whispering Sludge and two Mutated Rats (from consuming the black ichor).</p>

            <h4>4. Sealed Door of the Elder Drain</h4>
            <p>
                A massive circular bronze door sealed with three arcane locks. Symbols include an eye, a key, and a spiral.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Opening Puzzle:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eye:</strong> Requires casting Detect Magic in the chamber</li>
                <li><strong>Key:</strong> Hidden in the elven statue’s mouth in the aqueduct</li>
                <li><strong>Spiral:</strong> A rotating floor tile puzzle must align spirals with flow markers (INT check DC 15)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Beyond the door lies a vault filled with ancient relics and the deeper tunnels (future expansion).</p>

            <h3>d. Backstory: The Well’s Origins</h3>
            <p>
                The town well predates Belladonna’s founding and is actually the surface vent of an ancient waterworks system built by the elven settlers of Yew long before human expansion.
                The cistern chambers were designed not only to store water but also to guard something older — a vault sealed by the elven sages to contain “whispers from below.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Over centuries, knowledge of the underground structure faded. During a failed excavation a decade ago, Magistrate Corvin Dellmar uncovered a relic — the Eye of the Unspeaking Court —
                which cursed the water supply and birthed the Whispering Sludge. He abandoned the site but left it under discreet observation.
