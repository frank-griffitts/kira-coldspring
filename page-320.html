        <img src="Illustrations/section-320-1.jpg" alt="Varis" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>The battlefield around you is chaos—a storm of magic and steel. Dark elves clash with the last remnants of your strength as Varis stands at the heart of the storm, his laughter echoing through the crumbling dark elf kingdom of Umbra’Thal. He’s already begun the ritual to sacrifice Baider, his magic crackling through the air like the very essence of darkness itself. You can feel the weight of his power pressing down on you.</p>

        <p>But you have to act now. Baider is chained to the altar, his face pale and strained as Varis's dark magic wraps tighter around him. Elias fights at your side, determined and relentless. His presence grounds you, even as your heart pounds with the memory of your choice—leaving Jorsh behind.</p>

        <p>Jorsh. His power, so raw and untamed, still lingers in the air, but it’s weakening. You know he felt the moment you turned from him to save Baider, and it’s tearing him apart. The connection between you fades as you rush toward the altar, leaving behind the intoxicating lure of his magic. You glance back for only a moment to see Jorsh fighting desperately against the oncoming tide of dark elves, his eyes filled with heartbreak as you run toward the one person who has always been there for you—Baider, the one who raised you like his own.</p>

        <p>“Kira, we have to hurry!” Elias shouts, pulling you from your thoughts. “We don’t have much time!”</p>

        <p>You push forward, your mind racing. Varis is powerful, perhaps too powerful to take down without help. But you’ve made your choice. You can’t let Baider die—not for this war, not for any promise of power or protection.</p>

        <p>Varis’s voice booms as he raises his hand, preparing to unleash the final strike. “Foolish girl,” he sneers. “You think you can defy me? I control this realm, and soon, I will control Belladonna! No one can stop me!”</p>

        <p>You lock eyes with Baider, his strength fading with each passing second. His gaze meets yours, and in it, you see the history you share—the years of training, of trust, of love that shaped you into who you are. He’s always been there, always believed in you. And now, you can’t let him down.</p>

        <p>With a fierce battle cry, you and Elias surge toward Varis, blades flashing as you fight through the last of his dark elf guards. Varis turns his attention to you, summoning dark tendrils of magic that lash out like whips, seeking to pull you down. But you press forward, determination in your heart, until you’re face-to-face with him.</p>

        <p>“I won’t let you destroy Belladonna!” you shout, raising your blade.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-320-2.jpg" alt="Kira and Varis" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>“Belladonna is already lost,” Varis growls, and he unleashes a blast of magic that knocks you back, sending you skidding across the stone floor. Pain shoots through you, but you force yourself to rise.</p>

        <p>“Kira!” Elias rushes to your side, blocking another strike from Varis. “We have to finish this!”</p>

        <p>Summoning all your strength, you charge forward again. With Elias at your side, you strike at Varis, each blow bringing you closer to victory. But Varis is relentless, his dark magic swirling around him like a hurricane.</p>

        <p>Just as Varis prepares to land the killing blow on Baider, you find an opening. You plunge your sword into Varis’s side, and for a moment, time seems to stop. His eyes widen in shock as the dark magic around him falters.</p>

        <p>“No...” Varis gasps, stumbling back. “This cannot be...”</p>

        <p>His power dissipates, and the dark elves begin to retreat. The ritual is undone. You rush to Baider, quickly freeing him from his chains. His eyes flicker open, and he gives you a weak, but grateful smile.</p>

        <p>“You did it,” he whispers. “You saved me.”</p>

        <p>You nod, tears threatening to spill as the weight of everything presses down on you. But there’s no time for relief. The ground begins to tremble, and the very fabric of Umbra’Thal seems to tear apart at the seams. The kingdom is collapsing.</p>

        <p>“Kira,” Elias says, his voice tense. “We need to get out of here.”</p>

        <p>But then you hear it—a whisper in the air, faint yet unmistakable. Jorsh.</p>

        <img src="Illustrations/section-320-3.jpg" alt="Jorsh" class="responsive-img" />

        <p>You look back toward where you left him, and there he stands, his once-mighty power fading. His eyes are full of pain, not from battle, but from you—your choice. His heart is shattered, and with it, his magic crumbles. Yet still, he stands tall, watching as the world around him falls to ruin.</p>

        <p>“Kira,” Jorsh says, his voice echoing in your mind. “I can hold the collapse back long enough for you to escape. But it will cost me everything.”</p>

        <p>“No!” you shout, stepping toward him. But Elias grabs your arm, pulling you back.</p>

        <p>“Kira, we need to go! He’s made his choice!”</p>

        <p>You meet Jorsh’s gaze, and for a moment, the world falls away. The connection you shared is still there, but it’s broken now—fragile and fleeting. Jorsh nods, his face etched with sadness.</p>

        <p>“I wanted you by my side,” he whispers. “But this... this is my final stand.”</p>

        <p>The ground beneath your feet cracks, and the sky above begins to tear open as the dark magic consumes Umbra’Thal.</p>

        <p>You have to decide now. Do you rush to Jorsh’s side, offering your strength to help him hold back the collapse? Or do you leave with Elias, ensuring Baider’s safety and fleeing the crumbling realm?</p>
